# Getting Started with ChatGPT for Legal Research
## For Complete Beginners

---

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a computer program (called "AI" or "artificial intelligence") that you can have conversations with. It can help explain legal concepts, find cases, and organize research.

**Think of it like:** A research assistant who's read a lot of legal materials and can help point you in the right direction.

**It is NOT:** A replacement for Westlaw, LexisNexis, or your professional judgment.

---

## The #1 Most Important Thing to Know

### ⚠️ ChatGPT Sometimes Makes Up Fake Cases

This is the biggest danger. The AI can generate completely fake case citations that look real but don't exist. Lawyers have been sanctioned by courts for submitting these fake cases.

**The solution:** Verify every single case in Westlaw or LexisNexis before using it.

---

## What You'll Need

### Required:
- [ ] A computer with internet
- [ ] A ChatGPT account (free - we'll set this up)
- [ ] Westlaw or LexisNexis access (you already have this)

### Optional but Recommended:
- [ ] ChatGPT Plus subscription ($20/month) - gives you better verification features

---

## Step-by-Step First Time Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to: **chatgpt.com**
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter your email address
4. Create a password
5. Verify your email (check your inbox)
6. You're in!

### Step 2: Get Your Instructions Ready (2 minutes)

1. On your computer, find the file called: **PASTE-INTO-CHATGPT.txt**
2. Open it
3. Keep it open - you'll need to copy from it in Step 4

### Step 3: Start a New Conversation (1 minute)

1. In ChatGPT, you should see a text box at the bottom that says "Message ChatGPT"
2. This is where you'll type

### Step 4: Paste Your Safety Instructions (1 minute)

1. Go back to **PASTE-INTO-CHATGPT.txt**
2. Select everything between the `---` lines (all the text)
3. Copy it (Ctrl+C on Windows, Cmd+C on Mac)
4. Go back to ChatGPT
5. Paste it in the message box (Ctrl+V on Windows, Cmd+V on Mac)
6. Press Enter or click the send button

### Step 5: Wait for Confirmation (30 seconds)

ChatGPT will respond saying it understands the rules. Something like:

> "I understand and will follow these rules for legal research assistance..."

When you see that, you're ready!

## Your First Research Question

Let's try a simple example:

**Type this into ChatGPT:**

```
I need Wisconsin state law on negligence.
What are the basic elements?
Please verify any cases you cite through web search.
```

**What should happen:**

1. ChatGPT will search the web (you'll see "Searching..." or similar)
2. It will explain the elements of negligence
3. It might cite some cases
4. It will show you how it verified those cases
5. It will remind you to verify independently

**What you do next:**

1. Look at the cases it provides
2. Go to Westlaw or LexisNexis
3. Search for those exact cases
4. Make sure they're real and say what ChatGPT claimed

---

## Every Time You Use ChatGPT

### Start-of-Session Checklist:

1. ✅ Open ChatGPT
2. ✅ Start a NEW conversation (don't continue old ones for new research)
3. ✅ Paste your safety instructions from **PASTE-INTO-CHATGPT.txt**
4. ✅ Wait for confirmation
5. ✅ Ask your question with the jurisdiction (state/federal/circuit)
6. ✅ Have Westlaw or LexisNexis open in another tab

### End-of-Session Checklist:

1. ✅ Verify every case you might use
2. ✅ Read the actual cases (don't rely on AI summaries for important work)
3. ✅ Shepardize or KeyCite them
4. ✅ Check they're still good law
5. ✅ Confirm they say what ChatGPT claimed

---

## Warning Signs - When to Stop

### 🚨 STOP if ChatGPT:

- Cites cases without showing how it verified them
- Says "I'm sure" or "definitely" without sources
- Gives you specific advice about what to do in your case
- Provides case details you can't find in Westlaw/LexisNexis
- Seems too confident or the answer seems too perfect

### When you see a warning sign:

1. Type: **"STOP - Did you verify that? Show me your verification steps."**
2. Check everything independently
3. If you can't verify it, don't use it

---

## Good Questions vs Bad Questions

### ✅ GOOD Questions:

**Example 1:**
```
I need Wisconsin state court law on the statute of limitations for legal malpractice.
What is the time limit? Please verify any statutes or cases you cite.
```
Why it's good: Specific jurisdiction, specific question, asks for verification

**Example 2:**
```
I'm researching 7th Circuit federal law on qualified immunity for excessive force.
What's the current test? Verify cases through web search.
```
Why it's good: Specific jurisdiction and court, specific doctrine, requests verification

### ❌ BAD Questions:

**Example 1:**
```
Tell me about contracts
```
Why it's bad: Too broad, no jurisdiction, no specific question

**Example 2:**
```
Should I file a motion to dismiss in my case?
```
Why it's bad: Asking for specific legal advice, not research

**Example 3:**
```
Find me cases that support my argument that [specific argument]
```
Why it's bad: Asking AI to generate cases for a predetermined conclusion

---

## Simple Rules to Remember

### DO:
✅ Paste safety instructions at the start of EVERY session
✅ Say what jurisdiction you need (Wisconsin, 7th Circuit, etc.)
✅ Ask ChatGPT to verify cases
✅ Check EVERYTHING in Westlaw or LexisNexis
✅ Read the actual cases before using them

### DON'T:
❌ Trust ChatGPT without verifying
❌ Put your client's name or identifying information in ChatGPT
❌ Skip verification even for "simple" things
❌ Use cases you haven't looked up yourself
❌ Submit anything to court without independent checking

---

## When to Use ChatGPT

### ✅ Good Uses:

- Understanding a legal concept you're unfamiliar with
- Getting started on research in a new area
- Finding potential cases to look at
- Organizing your thoughts and arguments
- Learning the basics of a doctrine

### ❌ Bad Uses:

- Final verification of case citations (use Westlaw/LexisNexis)
- Checking if cases are still good law (use Shepard's/KeyCite)
- Looking up local court rules (check court websites)
- Anything you'll submit to court without verifying
- Replacing your professional judgment

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem: "I can't find the case ChatGPT cited in Westlaw"

**Solution:**
1. The case might be fake (AI hallucination)
2. Tell ChatGPT: "I can't find this case in Westlaw. Please verify it exists."
3. Don't use it if you can't verify it
4. Ask ChatGPT for different cases

### Problem: "ChatGPT's answer seems too perfect"

**Solution:**
1. Be suspicious - if it seems too good to be true, it might be
2. Ask: "What's your confidence level on this? Show me your sources."
3. Verify everything extra carefully

### Problem: "I don't understand what ChatGPT is saying"

**Solution:**
1. Ask: "Can you explain that more simply?"
2. Or: "Can you give me an example?"
3. Or: "What does [specific term] mean?"

### Problem: "ChatGPT didn't ask for my jurisdiction"

**Solution:**
1. You tell it: "This is for Wisconsin state law" (or whatever jurisdiction)
2. Then ask your question again
