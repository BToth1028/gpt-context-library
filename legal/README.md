## ⚖️ Critical Principles

### The Three Non-Negotiables:

1. **Verify Every Case**
   - ChatGPT must search web before citing
   - You must check Westlaw/LexisNexis before using
   - No exceptions, ever

2. **You Are Responsible**
   - AI is a tool, not a replacement for judgment
   - Everything you file is your responsibility
   - Professional duties still apply

3. **When In Doubt, Verify**
   - If something seems wrong, it probably is
   - Red flags require immediate verification
   - Better to over-verify than under-verify

---

## 🛡️ How This Protects You

### Forces ChatGPT To:
✅ Verify every case via web search before citing
✅ Show verification steps explicitly
✅ Ask for jurisdiction before providing law
✅ Give confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE)
✅ Include verification disclaimers
✅ Say "I cannot verify" instead of guessing

### Protects Against:
❌ Hallucinated fake cases
❌ Wrong jurisdiction applied
❌ Overconfident unverified answers
❌ Specific legal advice (keeps it research-only)
❌ Outdated information
❌ Professional sanctions

---

## 📋 Usage Workflow

### Every Session:
1. Start new ChatGPT conversation
2. Paste contents of **PASTE-INTO-CHATGPT.txt**
3. Wait for ChatGPT to confirm understanding
4. Ask question with jurisdiction specified
5. Watch for red flags
6. Verify everything in Westlaw/LexisNexis

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Case exists in Westlaw/LexisNexis
- [ ] Citation is accurate (volume, reporter, page, year)
- [ ] Case is from correct jurisdiction
- [ ] Case says what ChatGPT claimed
- [ ] Case is still good law (Shepardize/KeyCite)
- [ ] Legal principle is correctly stated

---

## 🚨 Red Flags

Stop immediately if ChatGPT:
- Cites cases without showing verification
- Seems overly confident without sources
- Provides specific advice for your case
- Gives case details you can't verify
- Doesn't ask for jurisdiction

**Response:** "STOP - Did you verify that? Show me your verification steps."
