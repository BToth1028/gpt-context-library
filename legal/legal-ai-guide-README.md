## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Open `legal-cheat-sheet.md` and read the "CRITICAL WARNINGS" section.

2. Open `legal-quick-start.txt`
3. Copy everything between the `---` lines
4. Paste into a new ChatGPT conversation
5. Wait for ChatGPT to confirm it understands

### Step 3: Try It (2 minutes)
Ask a simple question with jurisdiction:
```
I need Wisconsin state law on negligence.
What are the elements? Verify any cases you cite.
```

Watch how ChatGPT responds - it should:
- Search the web
- Show verification steps
- Give confidence level
- Include disclaimer

### Step 4: Verify (Important)
Whatever cases ChatGPT provides, look them up in Westlaw/LexisNexis before using them professionally.

---

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ GOOD: ChatGPT Helps You Find a Line of Cases

**You ask:** "I need 7th Circuit cases on qualified immunity for excessive force claims. Verify all citations."

**ChatGPT:**
- Searches the web
- Finds 3-4 relevant cases
- Shows verification steps
- Gives confidence level: MEDIUM
- Says "Verify these in Westlaw before citing"

**You then:**
- Look up each case in Westlaw
- Read the relevant sections
- Shepardize them
- Use the verified cases in your brief

**Result:** You found cases faster than manual searching, but still verified everything. ✅

---

### ❌ BAD: ChatGPT Cites Unverified Cases

**You ask:** "Find me cases supporting my argument that..."

**ChatGPT:**
- Immediately lists 5 cases
- Doesn't show verification
- Seems very confident
- Provides convenient quotes

**You then:**
- Copy cases into your brief WITHOUT CHECKING
- File the brief
- Opposing counsel notes cases are fake/misquoted
- You face sanctions

**Result:** Professional disaster. ❌

---

### ✅ GOOD: You Catch an Error

**ChatGPT cites:** "Smith v. Jones, 123 F.3d 456 (7th Cir. 2020)"

**You think:** "That doesn't look right..."

**You respond:** "STOP - Did you verify that case? I can't find it in Westlaw."

**ChatGPT:**
- Apologizes
- Searches again
- Says "I cannot verify this case - do not rely on it"
- Provides different, verified cases

**Result:** You caught the error before using it. ✅

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need ChatGPT Plus?
**A:** Not required, but recommended if you'll use this regularly. Web browsing helps with verification.

### Q: Can I use this for [specific legal task]?
**A:** Research and understanding concepts: Yes. Final verification: No. Everything must be independently verified.

### Q: What if I find an error?
**A:** Tell ChatGPT "STOP - that's incorrect" and ask it to verify. Then verify independently before using anything.

### Q: Can I skip verification for simple things?
**A:** No. Verify everything you'll use professionally. Simple things can still be wrong.

### Q: Is this ethical?
**A:** Yes, IF you use it as a research assistant and verify everything. Check your state bar for specific guidance.

### Q: What about client confidentiality?
**A:** Do NOT put client-identifying information into ChatGPT. Use hypotheticals and general legal questions only.

### Q: Can I share this guide?
**A:** Yes, share with any attorney who needs it. Update it as you learn more.

## Red Flags - Stop Immediately

🚨 **ChatGPT cites cases without showing verification**
→ Ask: "Did you verify that case? Show me your steps."

🚨 **ChatGPT seems overly confident**
→ Ask: "What's your confidence level? What sources?"

🚨 **You can't find the case in Westlaw**
→ Don't use it. Tell ChatGPT it appears incorrect.

🚨 **The case quote seems too perfect**
→ Read the actual case to confirm.

🚨 **ChatGPT gives specific advice**
→ Remind it: "I need research only, not advice."

---

## When AI Is NOT Sufficient

❌ **Shepardizing/KeyCiting** - Must use Westlaw/LexisNexis
❌ **Local court rules** - Check court websites and local practitioners
❌ **Complex statutory schemes** - Need complete statutes and legislative history
❌ **Final case citations** - Must verify in legal databases
❌ **Procedural deadlines** - Too important to risk error
❌ **Client-specific advice** - Need full context and professional judgment

---

## Best Practices Summary

### DO:
✅ Paste instructions at start of each session
✅ Specify jurisdiction every time
✅ Ask ChatGPT to verify and show its work
✅ Check everything in Westlaw/LexisNexis
✅ Read actual cases before citing
✅ Use for learning and research directions
✅ Keep web browsing enabled
✅ Save time on initial research

### DON'T:
❌ Trust without verifying
❌ Put client information in ChatGPT
❌ Skip verification for "simple" things
❌ Cite cases you haven't read
❌ Assume jurisdiction applies
❌ Rely on AI for final verification
❌ Submit anything without independent checking
❌ Let convenience override duty

## Final Reminders

### For Every ChatGPT Session:
1. Paste the quick-start instructions
2. Specify jurisdiction

4. Check confidence levels
5. Verify independently
6. Read actual cases

- **You are responsible** (can't blame the AI)
- **Verification is mandatory** (not optional)
- **Accuracy over speed** (always)

### The Bottom Line:
Use ChatGPT to work smarter and faster, but never shortcut the verification that your professional duties require.
