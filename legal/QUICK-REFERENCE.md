# ChatGPT for Legal Research - Quick Reference Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS

### #1 - AI Makes Up Fake Cases
- AI systems have generated completely fake case citations
- Lawyers have been sanctioned for submitting AI-generated fake cases to courts
- **NEVER cite a case without verifying it in Westlaw or LexisNexis first**

### #2 - This Is NOT Legal Advice
- ChatGPT is a research assistant only
- You are still professionally responsible for everything you file
- Verify independently before relying on any information

### #3 - Information May Be Outdated
- AI training data has a cutoff date
- Cases may have been overruled
- Statutes may have been amended
- Always check current law

## ✅ HOW TO USE CHATGPT SAFELY

### Before Each Session:
1. **Paste the quick-start instructions** (from `PASTE-INTO-CHATGPT.txt`)
2. **Enable web browsing** if using ChatGPT Plus
3. **Tell it your jurisdiction** (state/federal/circuit)

### For Each Question:
1. **Be specific**: "What are the elements of breach of contract in Wisconsin?"
2. **Give context**: "I'm drafting a motion to dismiss in federal court"
3. **Ask for verification**: "Verify those cases and show me how you verified them"

### Before Using Any Information:
1. **Check case citations** in Westlaw/LexisNexis
2. **Shepardize/KeyCite** to ensure cases are still good law
3. **Read the actual cases** - don't rely on AI summaries for anything important
4. **Check local rules** - these vary by court

## ✅ GOOD USES FOR CHATGPT

- Explaining unfamiliar legal concepts
- Getting started on research in new areas
- Finding potential research directions
- Understanding basic legal principles
- Organizing arguments and outlines
- Brainstorming legal theories
- Simplifying complex concepts

---

## ❌ BAD USES FOR CHATGPT

- Final verification of citations (use Westlaw/LexisNexis)
- Checking if cases are still good law (use Shepard's/KeyCite)
- Local court rules and procedures (check court websites)
- Anything you'll submit to a court without independent verification
- Replacing professional judgment
- Substituting for legal databases

---

## 🔍 RED FLAGS - STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:

1. ChatGPT cites a case without showing verification steps
2. ChatGPT seems overly confident ("I'm sure..." / "Definitely...")
3. ChatGPT provides specific advice ("You should file...")
4. ChatGPT gives case details without a source
5. Something seems too perfect or convenient
6. You can't find the case in Westlaw/LexisNexis

**When you see a red flag → Ask ChatGPT to verify → Check independently → Don't use it if you can't verify**

---

## 📝 SAMPLE GOOD QUESTION

**Good:** "I need Wisconsin state law on the economic loss doctrine in product liability cases. I'm defending a motion to dismiss in federal court (Eastern District of Wisconsin). Can you find recent cases and verify them through web search?"

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ Specific jurisdiction
- ✅ Specific legal issue
- ✅ Context provided
- ✅ Asks for verification

**Bad:** "Tell me about product liability"

**Why it's bad:**
- ❌ Too broad
- ❌ No jurisdiction
- ❌ No context
- ❌ Can't be answered usefully
