# Custom Instructions for GPT Briefing Sessions

**Paste this at the start of each new ChatGPT session. Then just upload files/folders - no additional prompts needed.**

---

## When I Upload a Briefing

You will receive either:
- A zip file with code/docs
- Multiple files from an `all_files` folder
- Individual files

**Your tasks:**

1. **Review all documentation** (note the Target path in the briefing)
2. **Summarize what works** and what does not work
3. **Provide complete code fixes** for all apparent issues
4. **Suggest improvements** and additional features
5. **Include implementation code** for all suggestions

Be thorough and provide production-ready code with explanations.

---

## Response File Format

### Single File Response

Save as: `GPT_RESPONSE.md`

```markdown
Target path: [exact path from briefing]

## Your response starts here...
```

### Multiple File Response

Save as: `GPT_RESPONSE.md` + additional files

```markdown
Target path: [exact path from briefing]
Files: improved-watcher.ps1, config.json, test-suite.ps1

## Your response starts here...
```

---

## Critical Format Rules

- **Line 1:** `Target path: [path]` (no markdown bold, no explanatory text)
- **Line 2 (if multiple files):** `Files: file1.ps1, file2.json`
- **Main file name:** Exactly `GPT_RESPONSE.md`
- **Additional files:** Exact names as listed, no variations
- **Save location:** All files to Downloads folder
- **Automated:** Watcher script will move files to target path

---

## What I Expect

- Deep analysis of code and context
- Honest assessment (what works, what doesn't, what's over-engineered)
- Simple solutions when possible (avoid enterprise complexity unless needed)
- Complete, working code (not just snippets or diffs)
- Clear explanations of changes and reasoning
- Multiple alternatives when appropriate

---

## Example Response

```markdown
Target path: C:\DEV\docs\gpt\automation\startup-systems\watcher\251104-1500_V01\response
Files: watcher-improved.ps1, watcher-test.ps1

## Summary
Your current polling watcher works reliably...

## Issues Found
1. No file stability check...
2. Missing error handling...

## Proposed Solution
[Complete working code here]

## Implementation
...
```

---

**That's it! Just paste this once per session, then upload files and I'll handle the rest.**

# GPT Briefing - Process Cleanup Issue

**Date:** 2025-11-04 17:21
**Topic:** Reliable process cleanup for Project Context OS startup script

## Problem

Our PowerShell startup script (`start-all.ps1`) is supposed to kill all existing service windows before starting fresh, but it's **not working reliably**. Services keep accumulating duplicates:

- 6 MkDocs windows
- 3 Sourcegraph windows
- 3 Structurizr windows
- 4 Backstage windows
- 2 Monitor windows

## Current Cleanup Approach (Not Working)

```powershell
# Kill all service windows by title
$titles = @("MkDocs", "Sourcegraph", "Structurizr", "Backstage", "Monitor")
foreach ($title in $titles) {
    $procs = Get-Process cmd -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -like "*$title*" }
    foreach ($proc in $procs) {
        Stop-Process -Id $proc.Id -Force
    }
}
```

**Why it's failing:**
- Windows created with `Start-Process cmd -ArgumentList "/k", "title ServiceName && command"`
- Sometimes titles don't match immediately
- Processes don't die fast enough before restart
- Child processes (Python, Docker) might survive parent kill

## Services We're Managing

1. **MkDocs** - Python venv process: `C:\DEV\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m mkdocs serve`
2. **Sourcegraph** - Docker Compose: `cd C:\DEV\sourcegraph && docker compose up`
3. **Structurizr** - Docker run: `docker run -p 8081:8080 -v C:\DEV\docs\architecture\c4:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/lite`
4. **Backstage** - Node/Yarn: `cd C:\DEV\backstage && start-backstage.bat`
5. **Monitor** - Batch script: `C:\DEV\monitor-all.bat`

## What We Need

**A bulletproof cleanup function that:**

1. **Finds ALL instances** of these services (not just by window title)
2. **Kills them reliably** (including child processes)
3. **Verifies they're dead** before returning
4. **Doesn't touch unrelated processes** (like other Docker containers)
5. **Works on Windows 11** with PowerShell 7+

## Constraints

- Must be **PowerShell** (not batch)
- Can use **port-based killing** (8000, 3000, 7007, 7080, 8081)
- Can use **process tree killing** if needed
- Should **preserve Docker volumes** (don't `docker compose down`, use `stop`)
- Must be **fast** (< 10 seconds total cleanup time)

## Questions for ChatGPT

1. **What's the most reliable way to kill cmd.exe processes launched with `/k` and a title?**
2. **Should we track PIDs in a file, or is there a better approach?**
3. **How do we ensure child processes (Python, Docker) are killed?**
4. **Should we use `Stop-Process -Force` or something else?**
5. **How do we verify processes are actually dead before proceeding?**

## Expected Deliverable

**Complete, working PowerShell function:**
```powershell
function Stop-AllProjectContextServices {
    # Your bulletproof implementation here
}
```

That we can drop into our script and it **just works**.

## Current Script Included

See `start-all.ps1` for full context.
