# GPT Briefing - File Watcher V03

**Date:** 2025-11-04 14:30
**Topic:** STOP OVER-ENGINEERING - Just Add Stability Check
**Previous Version:** V02 (you provided complex solution, we rejected it)

## Critical Feedback on V02 Response

Your V02 response completely ignored our request for simplicity. We explicitly said:
- "Keep it simple - no over-engineering"
- "No complex queues, timers, health checks, or scheduled tasks"

You gave us:
- Complex debounce timer systems
- Concurrent queues
- JSONL structured logging
- Health heartbeat files
- Scheduled task monitoring

**This is NOT what we want.**

## What Actually Happened

Our **simple polling watcher worked perfectly**. It successfully detected and moved your V02 response file. The proof: your response is in the correct folder.

We don't need enterprise monitoring systems. We need a simple, reliable script.

## What We Have (That Works)

See attached `gpt-response-watcher.ps1`:
- Polls Downloads folder every 2 seconds
- Checks if `GPT_RESPONSE.md` exists
- Reads target path from file content
- Moves file and exits (one-shot mode)
- ~150 lines, easy to understand

**This code is good. We want to KEEP it.**

## What We Want From You

**DO NOT rewrite our script.**

Instead, provide:
1. A code snippet for a `Test-FileStable` function that verifies file size isn't changing
2. A code snippet showing where to add it in our existing polling loop
3. Brief explanation of why checking file stability matters
4. Any other small improvements as **optional snippets** (not full rewrites)

## Example of What We Want

```powershell
# Add this function at the top
function Test-FileStable([string]$path, [int]$checkMs = 500) {
    # your code here
}

# Insert this check in the existing polling loop around line 110:
if (Test-Path $targetFile) {
    # ADD THIS:
    if (-not (Test-FileStable $targetFile)) {
        continue  # File still writing, check again next loop
    }
    # THEN continue with existing move logic
}
```

## What We DON'T Want

- Full script rewrites
- Complex enterprise architectures  
- JSONL logging systems
- Health monitoring files
- Scheduled tasks
- Pester test suites
- Git sync rewrites

## Summary

Give us small, targeted improvements to our working code. Code snippets, not rewrites. Simple explanations, not architecture diagrams.

We're building a personal automation tool, not deploying to production Kubernetes clusters.
